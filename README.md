# The Problem it solves

Personally as Web3 user, I use Metamask as wallet but I have multiple tokens in the multiple chains like Ethereum, Polygon, Binance, Solona etc. So whenever I want to check holding of any token, I have to go to Metamask, change network or switch account, add tokens or go to etherscan and after all hustles I am able to see my holdings (PS: Everyone hides tokens). I always wanted a tool that shows everything at one place like tokens, swap, trasnfer funds etc. So I came up with let's make a dApp that allows to do things like view Balance, Transfer Funds, view Transaction History, DEX, NFTs.

# Challenges

I wanted to do it Cross Chain because that is major issue I can see but with help of Moralis, I solved it. I want to add more chains in near future like Solana. This dApp only allows user to use their testnets like Goreli, Mumbai and BSC Testnets, Will implement to access Mainnet very soon.
